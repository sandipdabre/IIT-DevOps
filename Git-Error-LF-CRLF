Question: -

warning: LF will be replaced by CRLF in file.

LF stands for Line Feed which is a way to represent the end of a line in UNIX-based systems. 
But in a Windows-based system, a line is usually expressed by CR (Carriage Return) and a line feed (LF).

This problem arises if you use UNIX based system (macOS) to push code, the code will have an LF ending.

If you use a windows machine, make modifications to the code, and do commit, 
it will be replaced by CRLF since git is smart and does not expect you to use LF on Windows OS.

Similarly, the opposite happens if the warning says, CRLF will be replaced by LF. 
You will lose windows based CRLF after commit/checkout, and LF will replace it.


Use Command:
git config core.autocrlf true
